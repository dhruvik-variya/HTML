       <p id="solar-1">The Solar System[c] is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it.[4] The largest of these objects are the eight planets, which in order from the Sun are four terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars); two gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn); and two ice giants (Uranus and Neptune). The Solar System developed 4.6 billion years ago when a dense region of a molecular cloud collapsed, forming the Sun and a protoplanetary disc.All four terrestrial planets belong to the inner Solar System and have solid surfaces. Inversely, all four giant planets belong to the outer Solar System and do not have a definite surface, as they are mainly composed of gases and liquids. 99.86% of the Solar System's mass is in the Sun and nearly 90% of the remaining mass are in Jupiter and Saturn. There is a strong consensus among astronomers that the Solar System also has eight dwarf planets, which consist of one asteroid-belt object – Ceres; four Kuiper-belt objects – Pluto, Haumea, Quaoar, and Makemake; and three scattered-disc objects – Gonggong, Eris, and Sedna</p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System">More info....</a><br><br>


        <p id="solar-2">There are a vast number of smaller objects orbiting the Sun, called small Solar System bodies. This category includes asteroids, comets, centaurs, meteoroids and interplanetary dust clouds. Many of these objects are in the asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter (1.5–4.5 AU), and the Kuiper belt just outside Neptune's orbit (30–50 AU).[d] Six of the major planets, the six largest possible dwarf planets, and many of the smaller bodies are orbited by natural satellites, commonly called "moons" after Earth's Moon. Two natural satellites, Jupiter's moon Ganymede and Saturn's moon Titan, are larger than Mercury, the smallest terrestrial planet, though they are less massive.The Solar System is constantly flooded by the Sun's charged particles, the Solar wind, forming the heliosphere. Pushed against by the surrounding interstellar medium of the Local Cloud, the Solar wind starts slowing at 75 to 90 AU (the termination shock), before being halted, resulting in the heliopause, the boundary of the Solar System to interstellar space. The outermost region of the Solar System is the Oort cloud, the source for long-period comets, extending from 2,000 AU to the edge of the Solar System's sphere of gravitational influence at up to 200,000 AU (3.2 ly). The closest star to the Solar System, Proxima Centauri, is 4.25 ly away. The Solar System orbits the Galactic Center of the Milky Way galaxy, as part of its Orion Spur, at a distance of 26,000 ly.</p><br><br>

        <p id="solar-3">The Solar System formed 4.568 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a region within a large molecular cloud.[e] This initial cloud was likely several light-years across and probably birthed several stars.[6] As is typical of molecular clouds, this one consisted mostly of hydrogen, with some helium, and small amounts of heavier elements fused by previous generations of stars.[7] As the pre-solar nebula[7] collapsed, conservation of angular momentum caused it to rotate faster. The center, where most of the mass collected, became increasingly hotter than the surrounding disc.[6] As the contracting nebula rotated faster, it began to flatten into a protoplanetary disc with a diameter of roughly 200 AU (30 billion km; 19 billion mi)[6] and a hot, dense protostar at the center.[8][9] The planets formed by accretion from this disc,[10] in which dust and gas gravitationally attracted each other, coalescing to form ever larger bodies. Hundreds of protoplanets may have existed in the early Solar System, but they either merged or were destroyed or ejected, leaving the planets, dwarf planets, and leftover minor bodies.[11][12]</p> <br>

        <p id="solar-4">The Sun is the dominant gravitational member of the Solar System, and its planetary system is maintained in a relatively stable, slowly evolving state by following isolated, gravitationally bound orbits around the Sun.[20] Although the Solar System has been fairly stable for billions of years, it is technically chaotic, and may eventually be disrupted (see Stability of the Solar System). There is also a small chance that another star will pass through the Solar System in the next billion years. Although this could destabilize the system and eventually lead millions of years later to expulsion of planets, collisions of planets, or planets hitting the Sun, it would most likely leave the Solar System much as it is today.The overall structure of the charted regions of the Solar System consists of the Sun, four smaller inner planets surrounded by a belt of mostly rocky asteroids, and four giant planets surrounded by the Kuiper belt of mostly icy objects. Astronomers sometimes informally divide this structure into separate regions. The inner Solar System includes the four terrestrial planets and the asteroid belt. The outer Solar System is beyond the asteroids, including the four giant planets.[22] Since the discovery of the Kuiper belt, the outermost parts of the Solar System are considered a distinct region consisting of the objects beyond Neptune.[23]</p>
